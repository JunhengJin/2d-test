Water-saving tips: 
1. You can put a 500ml water bottle or a brick full of water in the toilet tank 
to reduce the amount of water every time you flush. 
2. First wipe off the oil stains on cooking utensils and tableware with paper, and then wash; 
3. Shower with water intermittently, turn off the water in time when scrubbing, 
and avoid showering for too long. 
The water after the bath can be used for washing cars, flushing toilets, mopping floors, etc.
